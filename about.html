			<p>Greetings, my name is Brian Valdez and this is a website created to showcase my MMP 210 projects.</p>
			<p>A brief autobiography about myself: I have always been open to many art forms and techniques, which is why my major is MultiMedia since I want to be able to experience and learn various forms and programming. Video Games has had a huge Impact on my life since my youth, and I have been open to playing all sorts of them, competitive ones being my preference. I later got into Japanese Animations which further assisted me to following the path I am taking now.</p>
